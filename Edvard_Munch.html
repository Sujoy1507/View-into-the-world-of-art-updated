                <em>The Scream</em>, created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893, is one of the most recognizable 
                and haunting images in the history of art. The painting depicts a figure standing on a bridge, 
                clutching its face in apparent agony, while the sky swirls with intense shades of red, orange, and yellow.

                Munch described the scene as a moment of overwhelming existential anxiety, inspired by his own experience 
                of feeling “a great scream” pass through nature. The distorted forms, bold colors, and expressive lines 
                capture an intense emotional state, making the work a cornerstone of the Expressionist movement.

                Several versions of <em>The Scream</em> exist, created using paint, pastels, and prints. The most famous 
                painted version is held at the National Gallery in Oslo, while another is in the Munch Museum. The work’s 
                universal theme of human anxiety has made it one of the most reproduced and parodied artworks in the world.
