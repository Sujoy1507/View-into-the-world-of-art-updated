                *The Starry Night*, painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889, is one of the most iconic works in the history 
                of Western art. Created during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, 
                the painting captures a dreamy interpretation of the view from his room, with swirling skies, glowing 
                stars, and a quiet village below.

                Van Gogh used bold, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant blues and yellows to create a sense of motion 
                and emotion. The swirling patterns of the night sky are both mesmerizing and deeply symbolic, often 
                interpreted as a reflection of the artist’s emotional turbulence and quest for peace. The cypress tree, 
                stretching upward like a flame, connects the earth with the heavens.

                Today, *The Starry Night* is housed in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. Its 
                combination of intense emotion, unique technique, and universal appeal has made it one of the most 
                beloved paintings in the world.
