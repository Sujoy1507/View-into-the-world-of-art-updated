                The <em>Mona Lisa</em>, painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506 (with possible later refinements), 
                is widely regarded as one of the most famous and studied works of art in history. This oil painting on a 
                poplar wood panel portrays a seated woman, traditionally identified as Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine 
                merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The subject’s enigmatic expression—often described as a subtle smile—has 
                fascinated viewers and scholars for centuries.

            <p>
                Leonardo’s mastery of <em>sfumato</em>, a technique that blends tones and colors without harsh lines, creates a 
                soft, almost dreamlike transition between light and shadow, giving the figure lifelike depth. Her gaze appears 
                to follow the viewer from any angle, enhancing the painting’s mysterious aura. The background features winding 
                paths, a distant bridge, and an imaginary landscape, blending realism with artistic invention.

                Measuring just 77 cm × 53 cm, the <em>Mona Lisa</em> is relatively small, yet it holds immense cultural and 
                historical significance. Today, it is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it is protected behind 
                bulletproof glass and admired by millions each year.
